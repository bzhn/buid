# buid
 UUID version b, created by bzhn. Currently is for creating UUID for files. This version of UUID stores timestamp as regular UUID v1. Also UUID with the b version says you about approximate size of file, hash sum and modulo of the file size, so you can check it before calculating the sum of big files for verification.
